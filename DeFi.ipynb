    "Decentralized finance (DeFi) is seen as an alternative to the institutionally controlled banking system, with tens of billions of dollars deposited into various decentralized smart contracts. Most of DeFi products and services use tokens to reward participants, incentivize users to lock their liquidity (called Yield Farming) to cover up the potential risk of spamming tokens, and maintain overvalued marginal prices which is unsustainable. Worse, these incentives are usually minting more new tokens, known as Emissions. These huge amounts of locked tokens are The sword of Damocles ready to destroy the DeFi market anytime. In this regard, we propose a DeFi model that is more responsible for the market, which has the following characteristics: 1. No emissions and no locked tokens. 2. Safe: the function of assets per unit is monotonically increasing over time. 3. It owns itself's liquidity which means lower transaction costs and more stable liquidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emission refers to the speed/rate at which new coins are minted and released as dictated by the protocols written onto the software of a given blockchain cryptocurrency. Sometimes referred to as emission curve, emission rate or emission schedule."

    "The auto market maker model(AMM) with a constant product K refers to a pricing method for passive transactions.

    "我们可以看到，发生一笔交易之后，对流动性池资产进行清算时，其每单元净资产会高于最初。和任何基于恒定K的流动性池一样，这部分净资产实际上来自于交易的滑点。事实上，发生一笔交易之后，流动性池的定价总是高估或低估F，如果delta足够大，这种定价偏离会非常明显，这可能给后来的交易者带来不利，例如过分高估了F的价值，而在买入后发生大幅亏损。或者产生套利空间，使得投机者有机会套取利益。\n",

    "因此，我们认为负责任的做法是在交易发生后立即实施价格平衡，使之回归其净资产担保状态。该行为可以视同F主动填补了套利空间。不难设想，当delta小于0时，也就是市场有交易者使用D买入了F并使F的定价高估，我们可以填补r_F'或减少r_D'使定价回归单位净值，二者对应的解释就是F主动填补了自己的套利空间，并选择将所得利益是否重复投入流动性池。反之依然，在delta大于0时，我们可以选择增加r_D或减少r_F来修正价格，操作空间则更为有限，F可以任意将F代币铸造给自己，但并不能无中生有铸造D。因此，如果之前没有发生过主动减少r_D结算部分利益的话，就只能选择减少r_F。\n",
